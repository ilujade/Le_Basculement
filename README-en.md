Rey, who tells the story, left and joined Chewie aboard the Millennium Falcon.

This story is originally written in French.

## Chapter 1
Chewie and I, aboard the Millennium Falcon, arrived on the planet Crait. The battle was raging. Resilient fighters were doing their utmost to eliminate a big machine that was apparently going to destroy the main gate of the cave where the base was located.  
Chewie and I then decided to help all these heroic pilots. We rushed towards the enemy hunters. After a few shots that killed several, we went back to attract them away from the battlefield. They followed us. We went through several tunnels and at the end, on leaving, we had destroyed them all. Some had hit walls, stalactites, and others had missed turns.  
We went up to see where the battle was. And there, what have we seen? The resistant hunters had disappeared or lay on the ground. And the opposing tanks were apparently beginning to advance. They were getting closer and closer to the cave door. All the resistance fighters had taken refuge there, except for some who could not reach it and hid in the trenches.

At that moment, I said no, everything could not be finished. There was still hope. The hope of saving everyone. Resistants. And Ben. Ben who could come back to the good side again.  
I then made a decision. A decision that could change the future of the galaxy. Our Millenium Falcon went to the enemy lines and approached the ship where Ben and the leaders of his army were. We received several shots. But, instead of fighting back, we sent a radio message:  
\- Stop, stop! Ben, I want to talk to you. It's me, Rey! Stop all this! I'm throwing you a challenge!

We arrived at the height of the ship. Ben and I glanced through the windows.  
\- Ben, if you really think it's the right solution, the dark side is the strongest, come on! Come on the battlefield! Let's fight a duel! Come, show that you are a real chef!

I cut the microphone and made Chewie sign to leave. We descended halfway between the great gate and the first enemy lines. I felt the conflict in Ben. I tried to send him a message by thinking intensely: _"Ben, come on I beg you! Ben, anyway, if you refuse such a challenge, your honor will be messed up. Come quickly! Come and show yourselves men that you are a true leader! Come and fight!"_  
I felt he had felt my call because I suddenly saw the ship go down and land. He went out, angry enough, and approached me a dozen meters away.

\-Rey, how dare you say that? How dare you challenge me? Look, you do not even have lightsaber and you dare to challenge me in front of everyone ?! You so want to ridicule you? he shouted.  
\- Ben, stop it all. That's not what you want, I replied calmly. You want to stop the war.  
\- Exactly, Rey, he replied. War is what you call your friends who make it. Look at all the hunters they sent. Come on, that's enough now.  
\- Yes, Ben, that's enough! We must finish: let's fight!

I motioned for Chewie to leave with the ship, leaving me alone in the plain. Ben was surprised by this act.  
I then dropped, hand on the floor. Ben thought I was kneeling in front of him.  
\- Ah, Rey, so that was your challenge? he told me. You just wanted to see if I was going to react? And now you surrender?

But even if my lightsaber had been destroyed during our confrontation in the Snoke room, I managed to steal one of the praetorian guns. I had hidden it on the floor. She was red like the floor. I then squeezed it in my hand and stood up, facing Ben.  
\- Ben, I may not have a lightsaber anymore, but there are other weapons. It's not just that one.

While exchanging a glance, we realized that there was no other solution. We had to face each other, face to face with our two armies. We exchanged several shots, front, side, back but we resisted as much as the other. Suddenly, I was able to jostle him and he fell. His lightsaber flew and I managed to catch him. He was facing me, unarmed.

\-So, Ben, are you saying that the dark side is the most powerful? I said, advancing towards him, who was beginning to fear the worst. You say that the dark side is the most powerful, but look: you, you have been trained for a long time and you have not managed to fight, I who knew nothing.  
\- Rey, shut up! he shouted furiously. Is that how you want to ridicule me in front of my army? Why did you go so far? You only had to do it right in front of the tanks.  
\- No, Ben, I do not want to ridicule you, I told him honestly. That's not what I want.  
\- Tell yourself, Rey, that now it is too late, that I will not come back. This is no longer possible ! But you, on the other hand, come with me!  
\- No, Ben! What you do is monstrous, stop all that.
\- You forget something, Rey, he said in a suddenly safer tone. Jedi art, the fight of the Jedi, is not limited to the lightsaber!

He then raised his arms in front of me and projected me a few meters further using the Force. I did not have my weapons anymore. He hastened to take his and came to me. I was still lying on the floor in shock. He put his foot on my back and pressed hard. Then, to my right, he brushed my face with his lightsaber.  
\- Rey, that's enough, you have no hope. Meet me ! he declared to me, victorious. Otherwise, the Resistance will see that its last hope is dead, that the one they hoped for is no more!

At that time I did not know what to do. I could not accept his proposal.  
But under my right hand I felt a big stone. I moved very slowly, because his lightsaber was really close to me. There was a big temperature difference between my nose close to this weapon and my left cheek lying on the ground in the snow. The snow that covered the red salt. He did not pay attention to my hand squeezing the stone. At the last moment, I rolled over and threw the stone in my face. I ran for my weapon. He was rubbing his face where the stone had hit him. But again we were face to face, intact, as if nothing had happened.  
We were getting closer to each other, we were turning around, ready to resume the fight.

But suddenly, Ben sat up and extinguished his lightsaber.  
\- Rey! I already told you ! We must finish with all these conflicts. Join me and let's join forces to bring peace to the galaxy and put an end to all these conflicts!  
\- Stop repeating yourself!

There, I felt that I held the destiny of the galaxy in my hands. I felt that I had no choice. It was not with the lightsaber that I could bring him to the light. It was not with lightsaber that I could bring order and peace to the galaxy. I did not want to go to the dark side, but lining up with him was the only way to get him back to the light. I lowered my weapon and got closer. He then held out his hand and asked me, in a very imploring tone:  
- Rey, please, join me!  
Gently, I raised my hand to his. Our hands came closer and the end of our fingers touched each other. He stared into my eyes, very moved.  
- Rey, thank you. Thank you very much.

I felt the inner conflict that was gnawing at him. I felt he was still divided in him. I did not regret anything.  
\- Ben, listen to me. If you want me to stay by your side, to become your ally, you'll have to swear things to me.  
\- What does it mean Rey? You put me conditions? he replied, lowering his hand.  
\- Ben, listen. I want to stay by your side, join forces with yours, but in exchange, swear by Force that you will not kill any more innocents or Resistants.

I saw him, faced with the dilemma. Either he gave up killing the Resistance or I stayed in the ranks of his enemies. He spoke again, looking me straight in the eye.  
\- Rey, I accept that oath, but in exchange you must also make me one.  
\- Which ? I replied, worried, asking myself what he would require of me.  
\- Rey, swear to me also by the Force that you will no longer fight with the Resistance and that you will stay by me, that you will support the order. And whatever happens.

At that moment, I knew that I could not go back. Never again.  
\- All right, Ben. I accept, I decided, my throat tight.  
\- Rey, he began earnestly, I swear to you by the Force that I will never kill innocents or Resistants. May the Force leave me, life will leave me if I miss my word. But I'm not naive, Rey: my oath will only be valid once yours is spoken.  
\- Ben, I swear to you by the Force that I will never fight with the Resistance again and that I will be at your side whatever happens, I said, tense. May the Force leave me, that life will leave me forever if I miss my word. And if one of us dies, then these oaths ... will always hold, I finish after a long silence of reflection.

There, I had to make a choice. I hesitated but told myself that my choice was the right one. The oath had to be there no matter what. Otherwise, if Ben died, I could go back to the Resistance, but if it was me who died first, then he could start killing again. In the chosen case, it was different: if I died, Ben could not start killing again and if he died I could always try to bring peace and order to the galaxy and make the union with those who want it too but who are in the other camp.  
Ben released his lightsaber and invited me to follow him, holding out my hand.

## Chapter 2
Going towards the ship, I heard behind me the desperate cries of the Resistance who did not understand my decision. The most heartbreaking was that of Leia, she who hoped so much to see his son back in the bright side, she who had placed in me all his hope for peace would see me leave too. But I did not regret anything. And I did not turn around.  
When we arrived at the side door of the ship, I glanced at the door of the cave. I saw that the Resistance had come out again, ready to resume the fight even if I was no longer with them. I then turned to Ben who was on my left.  
\- Ben, what are you going to do now?  
\- Rey, I already told you, we must finish with all that.

In a dry and authoritarian tone, he called a general. I turned and saw a scornful man coming out of the ship. It was the man I saw next to Ben when I started the challenge.  
\- Yes, Supreme Leader? he asked curtly.  
\- General Hux! We must finish once and for all with the Resistance! Tell your troops to move on!

I could not believe what I had just heard. But the tanks were starting to restart. I turned my head to Ben, stunned.  
\- Ben, what does that mean? You just sw...  
\- Shut up ! he said to me with a very dark look.

I did not know what to do. I heard the tanks move forward and swore not to go back there.  
Suddenly, I understood. Ben had detected a weakness in his oath: he had sworn not to kill himself, but not to order. Then, realizing that in mine too there was a fault, I turned around and ran straight to the Resistance.  
\- Rey! Ben shouted. Rey, what are you doing? Come back !  
He ran behind me, but the Resistance, seeing me coming back, regained hope and then shot in his direction. He had to stop. He immediately told his general to stop shooting. He did not want to touch me. Then, getting closer to the first resistant lines, I saw my friends running towards me. Once among them, I made a sign to them not to cry so as to be able to hide myself in their ranks. I stooped and ran a little in all directions, so Ben did not know where I was. Thus, he could not order his troops to shoot all Resistance except those close to me. Ben kept calling me. I shut up. But his tone became more and more heartbreaking and I began to feel hatred in his words, frustration. He felt betrayed and even I think he was starting to be afraid that, missing my word, I was dead.  
I then got up and talked to him.  
\- I'm here Ben!  
\- Where ? Advance! yelled it.

I started to move forward and he could spot me. So, with a gesture of his arms he dismissed all the Resistance on my way and came to me. I continued to walk towards him. I heard the Resistance again screaming. But here it was cries of encouragement, cries that pushed me to challenge him again. But on the contrary I continued to move towards Ben and I arrived in front of him.  
\- Ben, I hope you understand this lesson.  
\- What? You just give me a lesson Rey? he replied furiously.  
\- Yes. I'll explain to you later.  
\- Later ? Do you think I'll trust your word again? You have just betrayed me!  
\- Ben, if I betrayed you, I will not be alive to tell you.

He realized that I was right and put his hand on the side of my arm, near the shoulder.  
\- Yes I see. I just got it. I found a weakness in my oath, and you found one in yours.

Seeing Ben's gesture, all the Resistants lost hope and howled. And this time, it was not pain. It was anger, hatred. But I did not watch them. I had no regrets. I knew what I had to do.  
Suddenly I heard a cry. I heard someone call me.  
\  Rey! Rey! Do not do that ! Rey! Come back !  
I turned my head and saw Finn come running. Ben reached for him and stopped him. He lifted it one meter off the ground. Finn was there, suspended and spinning on himself. Then, without a glance at him, we went back to the ship.

Once on board, the ship flew to resume its position above the tanks. Through the windows, I saw the Resistance more determined than ever to fight against the First Order.  
\- General Hux! Tell your troops to finish once and for all with these Resistants! Ben ordered.  
\- Yes, Supreme Leader, the general answered before leaning toward the central microphone to broadcast the order.  
Belly tight, I saw the tanks start and all the troops pull towards the Resistance. Some were shot, but the lucky ones managed to return to the cave and close the front door. I felt angry Ben seeing the low enemy losses.  
\- General, how long will the ram gun be able to fire? he asked, impatient and upset.  
\- Hum hum ... In about thirty minutes, Supreme Leader. It's only a matter of time.  
\- Thirty minutes ?! By then, the Resistance will have found a solution to escape! Ben shouted, turning around. General! Send troops into the mountains to take them back if they ever try to flee without our knowledge!

\- But, Supreme Leader, there is no other way out. This base is old and we could get the plans. There is no other way out.  
\- Do what I tell you! Ben shouted, strangling the general from a distance. And also send hunting patrols!  
\- A... At... your orders, said the general with great difficulty.

Ben released him and the general hastened to give the required orders.  
I, for my part, had forced myself not to react. It was difficult, and I even had to walk away from the windows towards the middle of the ship so as not to see all that. I could not tilt Ben's situation or intentions so quickly. I had to be patient. Suddenly, an idea crossed my mind and allowed me to regain hope for the life of the Resistants, while remaining faithful to my alliance with Ben.  
\- Ben, I said, turning to him, I think there is a more radical solution that would be extremely beneficial to you.  
He turned to me, his eyes dark and deep. Without taking my eyes off him, I felt that his men dreaded the worst for me. But instead of catching my throat and pushing me violently towards him, he came to me. Without paying attention to the others who, I think, were surprised at the Supreme Leader's reaction to me, I stared at Ben as he stared into my eyes.  
\- Rey, never call me that way in front of my men! he said dryly to me when he arrived in front of me.  
\- What ?! but how then? I asked him, knowing that I would never call him Supreme Leader, even if he ordered it to me.  
\- Kylo. Here I am Kylo Ren. he answered gravely.  
\- Alright, I said reluctantly. Kylo, ​​I found another solution. A solution that could put the galaxy at your feet.

He was surprised. Astonished to see the support I already gave him in the fight against the Resistance, who were still my allies a few hours ago. General Hux approached, suspicious.  
\- Explain yourself, Ben asked me, interested.  
\- If you kill all of the Resistance here, you will start a new home of hatred and revolt in the galaxy, I began. Instead of execu ...  
\- Supreme Leader! cut off the general. This woman is trying to manipulate you! All she wants is to save her friends! She's part of the Resistance, do not forget it! he continued, giving me a look of contempt.  
Ben then turned to him and grabbed him by the throat.  
\- This woman is now my ally! And I advise you not to disrespect him any more!  
Seeing that he had no choice, the general had to bow to Ben's will.  
\- My ... my respects ... uh ... Rey? he said hesitantly on my name.  
\- Highness! pronounced Ben, in a very insistent tone.  
\- My respects, my respects Your Highness," said the general, who was then released by Ben.

I could not understand what I had just heard. Ben wanted me to be a Highness ?! Did he give me a highly hierarchical place in the First Order or was it just so that his men did not call me by my first name?  
\- Well, let's resume, he said, turning to me.
\- B ... Kylo, ​​do not execute the Resistants. Take them hostage and circulate in the galaxy that as long as the systems will remain faithful to you, nothing will happen to them. Moreover, I continued in front of Ben who seemed interested, shows today that you are the legitimate chief of the First Order, that you are the Master of the Force!  
I saw General Hux ready to convince Ben not to listen to me, but the mere look I gave him decided to shut him up. Ben, more and more intrigued by my solution, was thinking. Then he asked me:  
\- Rey, what you're telling me is interesting. It's a good strategy. But how do you want me to take hostage these Resistants locked in the cave without taking up arms? By besieging them? It would take too long.  
\- Yes, Supreme Leader, the General confirmed with a smirk, satisfied that Ben was not convinced by my proposal.  
\- Using your Mastery of the Force, I said slowly, looking right at Ben's eyes. Use the Force to open the door. No one will dare to challenge you after that!

A long silence followed my statement. After a good deal of thought, Ben turned his back on me and ordered the general to approach the troops of the door sufficiently without firing. At the time, I did not know what to think: had he chosen to keep the initial strategy, or ordering the troops not to fire meant that he was going to implement my plan?  
The troops and our ship were approaching the cave. Facing the window, Ben suddenly ordered the troops to stop. He turned to the general and demanded that he convey that no enemy should be shot. I felt at that moment a great relief in me. Ben had chosen my plan! But I had to repress my emotions quickly because I felt my eyes start to shine, something I could not afford. I was the ally of Kylo Ren, Supreme Leader of the First Order and supporter of the Dark Side. I had to remain neutral, even impassive. Whether it's for me or helping Ben control his impulses.  
Then Ben ordered to land the ship. The general was looking at me, very contemptuous. But I was not paying attention. If I had chosen to be next to Ben, it was to bring him back to the bright side, not to win the friendship of his staff.  
Ben then went to the door of the ship. But the general intervened:  
\- Hum hum ... Supreme Leader ... Can I allow you to notice a detail?  
\- Which ? Ben said, turning around.  
\- I do not question his Highness's plan, he began coldly, pointing to my chin, as if afraid of being immediately strangled. But, how should my men react if the Resistancts begin to shoot at you?  
I saw that Ben had not thought of that and seemed upset by this oversight. After a short thought, he turned to me and waved me to follow him.  
\- Tell your men not to intervene until the door is opened. For Resistance shooting, my ally will cover me.

We left the ship, in front of him. His last sentence echoed in me. _"My ally will cover me."_ What did he mean? That I was going to serve him as a human shield? That I was going to shoot the Resistance so that they do not come out of their shelters? I stood beside him and we walked to the door.  
\- Ben, what do you want me to do? What did you mean to cover? I do not have a weapon on me.  
\- No, but I do, he replied, continuing to walk without turning his head.  
\- What ?!  
\- You swore to always support me, did not you? he pointed out. I trust you, Rey. Take my lightsaber and hijack all the shots in our direction.  
Hearing these words, I was shocked. I watched it and stopped walking. Seeing me no longer at his side, Ben turned around and saw that I was a few steps behind, stunned.  
\- Rey, I'm not kidding," he said. Here, here is my weapon. I lend it to you. Because, in addition to saving our lives by using it, you will prove to everyone that you are my ally.  
I took his weapon and went back to the door. My heart was beating louder and louder, resonating throughout my body. I felt concern and compassion settle on my face. And that was no longer possible. I then focused on what was going to happen and realized that my face was becoming firmer, my eyes darker. I was satisfied. Not because that's what I wanted to become internally, but because I started to play the part I had to play with Ben.

Arrived a good distance from the door, we stopped, facing it. Head straight, proud, I lit the lightsaber. Ben then spoke:  
\- Resistants, your future is now in my hands! You could not escape!  
A Resistant fired at Ben, but with the lightsaber I was able to deflect him and Ben was not hit. Other shots then left but were also stopped by my weapon. At a glance, Ben and I realized that the time had come. He stretched out his arms in front of him and began a terrible effort to lift the door. But it did not move. I felt Ben lose hope of success and start to regret having followed my plan. Between shots, I encouraged him by saying that he could do it. Long seconds passed. But nothing. I too began to doubt. When suddenly, the door began to shudder and then climb slowly and open. From time to time glancing at Ben, I saw that he had regained all confidence in my plan and that his power had almost doubled.  
\- Rey, order my troops to intervene!  
I turned around for a moment to signal to the general that the assault could be launched. I saw the Stormtroopers start moving forward. Alas, I stayed a moment too much turned back and I felt a shock. I had just been touched. The pain was so severe that I could not define where the wound was. I then fell and lost consciousness, without being able to see the end of the battle.

## Chapter 3
When I woke up, I was still on the battlefield. But I did not hear any shots. Opening my eyes, I saw that night had fallen. I wanted to get up but an excruciating pain in my back blocked me in my movement. At that moment, everything came back to me. My duel with Ben. My covenant with him and the First Order. The opening of the door by Ben, and me who defended it.  
My memories returned, I looked around. And I was surprised. The tanks of the First Order were stopped, extinguished in the middle of the battlefield, as were the fighters and other vessels of the First Order. The cave was almost closed, with light and shouts of joy inside.  
What had happened? The Resistance had finally won? No. The equipment of the First Order would not be intact. My plan had worked then. But in this case, what were all the noises in the cave like? I could not imagine Ben launching festivities to celebrate his victory.  
Finding a big metal bar, I could get up. Slowly. Then I went to the cave to learn more. But at one point I put my crutch on an object and lost my balance. I fell. I tried to get up but it was very difficult. I saw a silhouette approaching me. I could not tell who this person was because she was against the light.  
\- Rey? Is it you, Rey?  
\- Yes Yes. It's me. I am here ! I replied, recognizing Poe's voice.  
He approached me and helped me up.  
\- Poe, what happened? Tell me, how was the battle ?! I said, worried and impatient to know what had become of Ben and the Resistance.  
\- Wait, it'll be long. Come get treatment, I'll tell you on the way, he said, passing my arm over his shoulders to support me.  
We then headed for the cave and Poe began to tell me.  
After Ben opened the door, the Stormtroopers began to invade the cave and capture the Resistants. When Ben returned, Leia saw him and could not help shouting his son's name and running towards him. Ben signaled to his troops to let it pass. She arrived in front of him and hugged him. And there, to the amazement of all, Ben pressed against him. He began to cry and confide all his remorse. Then, taking her by the shoulders, he confessed that all this was due because of Snoke, who had mounted against his family and the light. He let go and told his troops that all these conflicts were over, that the light side had won and that the time of the war was over.  
I could not believe everything Poe was telling me. I was satisfied. The war was over. The First Order and the Resisters had reconciled.  
Arriving at the door, I saw everyone celebrate the return of peace and the victory of light. My eyes crossed that of Ben, who, happy to see me again, got up and came to me.  

\- Rey! Rey! Do you hear me ?  
\- Ben? I tried to say, recognizing his voice.  
But suddenly, I realized that I was not in the cave. That no festivity took place. I was lying down. Lying on a bed.  
\- Rey! Rey, can you hear me? I heard again. If you do, shake my hand.
When I tried to move my hands, I felt that one of them was on someone else's. On Ben's. I tense my hand.  
\- Yes, that's it, she heard me! said Ben, reassured.  
Feeling a great activity around me, I forced myself to open my eyes. I live many people around me.  
\- Ben ... where am I? I asked him slowly.  
\- In the infirmary room on my ship, Rey.  
\- In the infirmary room of your ship, I repeated.  
In my head, all the events went by. The battle. The dual. My alliance. The opening of the big door. The festivities. The festivities ? But what happened there so that I do not remember anything except my entry into the cave? If I had lost consciousness again, how was it that only Ben was at my bedside? Where were Leia, Finn, Poe?  
All these questions made me suddenly come to my senses. Spontaneously, I straightened up. Sitting on my bed, I fixed Ben.  
\- Ben! Where are the others ? Where is your mother ? Finn? Poe? What happened ?!  
The caregiver was starting to worry about my reaction. One of them went to Ben and wanted to talk to him. But Ben, the ignorant, spoke to me. The man was silent.  
\- But,Rey, they're in the holds. Locked up, as your plan indicated, he replied, surprised.  
\- My plan, I repeated, with a sudden doubt as to what had really happened. Ben, please, tell me how was the end of the battle!  

Once again, the doctor wanted to intervene. But Ben cut him again and ordered him to stop interrupting this discussion, to leave us alone. The doctor bowed and ordered all the staff out. Once gone, Ben began his story.  

Still holding the gate of the cave open, he saw me fall, unconscious. But he had to wait for his troops to take possession of the gate controls inside the base to release his arms and come to see me. Seeing that I was unconscious but still alive, he took me aboard his ship to heal me. Meanwhile, his troops captured all the Resistance. And to make sure no one was left, they set fire to the base. Then everyone was taken aboard the ships parked near the planet.  
At the end of his story, I stayed a long time in my thoughts. I tried to understand. According to Ben, my plan went as planned. The Resistance had been captured. The base destroyed. Ben took me unconscious aboard her ship. But then, that meant I never woke up on the battlefield! No festivity had occurred! I went down. I felt the bitterness settle in me. The war was not over. Nobody was reconciled.  
Ben, intrigued by my reaction, reached for my head. He wanted to read in me, to understand what was happening. But he did not have time.  
The machines began to beep very quickly, very loudly. The doctors, in spite of Ben's formal order, returned to the room.  
\- Forgive us, Supreme Leader, said one of them, fear in his stomach. But we must intervene. It's urgent ! he continued, inviting Ben to get up and walk away from the bed.  
They inspected the machines and put a mask on my nose and mouth.

Then everything became normal again. The doctors stayed in front of the screens.  
\- It's incredible.  
\- I had never seen this before.  
\- Awesome.  
\- Yes, his fatal wound is nothing compared to that.  
\- I can not believe it...  
These words frightened me. My injury, which apparently could have cost me my life, was nothing compared to what they observed? What was so bad about me? Worried, I looked at Ben. He stared at the stars through the window. He was also troubled by the words of the doctors. No longer able to hear these words without knowing what they were, he turned around and approached the doctors. He gave me a quick glance to reassure me, to make me understand that he would not let me down.  
\- What is going on ? he asked gravely.  
\- Supreme Leader, replied one of them, the case of His Highness Rey is extraordinary.  
\- What ?! You find that my ally is _extraordinary_? Ben said jealously, taking the doctor by the throat.  
\- No, no, that's not what you think," said another doctor.  
Ben then relaxed his hand around the doctor's neck. But he did not release him. I saw in his eyes a great determination to save me.  
\- Explain yourself.  
\- Supreme Leader, the wound of your ally should have killed her. But, by a miracle, she knew how to resist it. Thanks to his will to live. We had never observed such a power of will.

I could not believe what the doctors had just said. My will to live had conquered death? No, it was not possible. To think that I was the first to resist death so frightened me. I wanted to watch the reaction of the doctors but they turned their backs on me, in front of Ben. He too seemed intrigued by this news. Intrigued, but not worried.  
He looked at me and saw in my eyes panic and fear. He then approached me and put his hand on mine to reassure me. His face expressed admiration. But not the admiration that an impressed child could have against a great Master. It was different. Softer, more compassionate. To see it react so warmed my heart. These emotions proved that there was still good in him. That I could keep hope and bring it back one day to the light. That I had made the right choice.  
Taking a firmer face, he turned to the doctors.  
\- How long will the healing of the wound last?  
\- Supreme Leader, considering the resistance of your ally, she will be able to leave tomorrow, one of the doctors answered, looking at his colleagues who confirmed. However, she will have to come back to do checks every day for ten days, he finished, turning to me.  
\- Good. Now, leave us alone.
